Assignment 3 for ELL 888 - Deep Learning course at IIT Delhi

Problem statement.
Choose 2 datasets - one gray scale and color each (except for MNIST). 

Design a classifier for a classification task on the choosen datasets. 

Design a generative model (GAN and it's variants or VAE and it's variants) on both datasets. 

Break the classifier by creating atleast 2 types of adversarial attacks on the trained classifiers. 

Finally use the trained generative models to make the classifier robust against those attacks.
